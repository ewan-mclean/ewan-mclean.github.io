## Safety first

{examples}

How do these quotes make you feel? Safe?

Do you genuinely believe that the safety of staff and customers is the first or only priority for these organisations?

If you do, you're the sort of naive and overwhelmingly positive fool the world needs more of.

## A dose of reality

Apart from a very few examples - I can think of organisatons like the Health and Safety Executive - safety is never the number one priority. Never.

Now that doesn't mean an organisation (or an individual) who says that doesn't have good intentions. They might rank safety reasonably high in their priorities, but it is not highest. What ranks highest is their raison d'etre. Making money. Catching criminals. Visiting your grandmother.

If Amazon's number one priority was safety, they wouldn't be running hundreds of warehouses with reversing trucks, motorized conveyor belts and other such finger-inserting opportunities. But we like buying chinese goods with next day delivery, so we do it.

If the police's first priority was safety, they would never attempt an arrest, because an officer might get hurt. A member of the public might get in the way. The alleged criminal will almost certainly be injured to some degree. But we like being safe from criminals, so we do it.

If your first priority was safety, you wouldn't visit your grandmother. The drive to her house puts you at risk. But you love oatmeal and raisin cookies, so you do it.

## Let's just be honest

We sacrifice safety for convenience every day. It's the reason that the motorway speed limit is 70mph, not 5mph. Or for that matter, why we're allowed cars at all, it would be safer after all if we walked everywhere.

But that kind of life would be very inconvenient, wouldn't it. So why can't we just be honest. We're absolutely fine giving up a little safety if it means we get our takeaway pizza that little bit faster.

There's a balance, and when they want to make an announcement like the ones above, what they should really be saying is "We've decided that we got the balance wrong. We are sacrificing a bit too much safety for profit, so we're going to spend more money on hard hats."

But it doesn't have quite the same ring does it?
