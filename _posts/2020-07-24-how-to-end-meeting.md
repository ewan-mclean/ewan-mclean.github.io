title: How to end a meeting

I know the answer now. With many thanks to the original source **[David Perell](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1280649978835132418)**:

>End meetings with five minutes of silent writing time.

>Answer the following questions:
>
> * What are my top takeaways?
> * What are the next steps?
> * What questions do I still have?
>
>Resist the urge to jump to the next activity.

I am guilty of finishing a meeting, promising to get something done and trusting that I'll remember it. I often forget. So my new thing is that before I leave any meeting room, the details of what I need to do will either be in a message to a delegate, or in my To Do app.
