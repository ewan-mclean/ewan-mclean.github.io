title: Essential wordpress plugins
---

Whenever I take responsibility for an existing wordpress site, or deploy a new one, my first step is to ensure these plugins are installed and configured. This ensures a stable baseline for operations. If you have any recommendations for the list please leave a comment below.

* [Link management (target and rel options)](https://cutt.ly/lgU5Idt) to keep people on my site and improve SEO.
* [Broken Link Checker](https://cutt.ly/LgU5HMo) to keep quality high and improve SEO.
* [Disable Comments](https://cutt.ly/3gU5LUE) as 90% of my clients don't want them, and nuking the function just saves so much hassle down the road with spam.
* [Under Construction](https://cutt.ly/RgU5L6h) if I don't have the luxury of a proper staging environment (shoutout [Cloudways](https://vrlps.co/PUqIZeV/cp)!) then I can quickly put a holding page up in a matter of seconds. Also useful for planned or unplanned maintenance pages.
* [WP Mail SMTP](https://cutt.ly/pgU5Zge) no matter how relaible my web server email might be, I want control of it, usually through Sendgrid or Mailgun.
